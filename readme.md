An experimental attempt at making an AI play Tetris on a gameboy emulator.

The project is based on https://github.com/PWhiddy/PokemonRedExperiments

After working on this for a while, I realized that my approach was probably very naive and the value function does not do a good enough job at guiding the Ai towards making good moves.
